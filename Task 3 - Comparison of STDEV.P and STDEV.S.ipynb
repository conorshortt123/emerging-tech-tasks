    "# TASK 3 - RESEARCH OF STANDARD DEVIATION FUNCTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief:\n",
    "*The standard deviation of an array of numbers x is\n",
    "calculated using numpy as **np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x))^2)/len(x))** .\n",
    "However, Microsoft Excel has **two different versions** of the standard deviation\n",
    "calculation, **STDEV.P and STDEV.S** . The STDEV.P function performs the above\n",
    "calculation but in the STDEV.S calculation **the division is by len(x)-1** rather\n",
    "than **len(x)**. Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell\n",
    "about the difference between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation\n",
    "demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard\n",
    "deviation of a population when performed on a sample. Note that part of this task\n",
    "is to figure out the terminology in the previous sentence.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences between STDEV.P & STDEV.S\n",
    "\n",
    "### STDEV.P:\n",
    "STDEV.P is an excel function used when calculating the standard deviation of an entire population. A population data set contains all members of a specified group, this is the entire list of possible data values. Uses the count of **n** in formulae.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the population may be \"ALL people living in the US.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### STDEV.S:\n",
    "STDEV.S is an excel function used when calculating a sample of a data set. A sample data set contains a part, or a subset, of a population. The size of a sample is always less than the size of the population from which it is taken. This utilizes the count of **n-1** in formulae\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The sample may be \"SOME people living in the US.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences:\n",
    "The only difference between the formulae is that for the sample standard deviation you divide by n-1, n is subtracted by 1 to get an unbiased sample deviation. Subtracting by 1 means that the sample standard deviation will be a **larger** number.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the example below to understand why n-1 is a better estimate for a sample variance.\n"
