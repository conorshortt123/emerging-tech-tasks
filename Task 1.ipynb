    "# Calculating the square root of 2\n",
    "\n",
    "*The square root of 2 or root 2 is represented using the square root symbol √ and written as √2 whose value is 1.414. This value is widely used in mathematics. Root 2 is an irrational number as it cannot be expressed as a fraction and has an infinite number of decimals. So, the exact value of the root of 2 cannot be determined.*\n",

    "Newton's Method of calculating square roots is an iterative root-finding algorithm, that produces successively better approximations of the root. Where ${\\alpha}_{0} $ is an initial approximation of $\\sqrt{N}$. If the initial approximation is suitably chosen, the process converges quickly and accurate approximations to $\\sqrt{N}$ are obtained after only a few iterations. However, if extended multiple-precision approximations to $\\sqrt{N}$ are sought, the computation time increases rapidly because of the times required for dividing ${N}$ by a many-digit number. Generally, the time required for floating-point division on modern electronic computers compared to floating-point multiplication is at least twice as much for double precision computations.\n",

    "![Iterational Accuracy](images/iterations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of the algorithm each time it runs. Where ${\\alpha}_{0}=1$, ${\\alpha}_{1}=1.5$, and so on for 5 iterations until it is accurate to 100 decimal places (python can only display 52).\n",
